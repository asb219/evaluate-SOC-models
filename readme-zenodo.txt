If this project is downloaded from Zenodo instead of GitHub (https://github.com/asb219/evaluate-SOC-models), the `MEND` directory is going to be empty. Please download the source code for the MEND model with

https://github.com/asb219/MEND/archive/refs/tags/MEND-new-asb219.zip

Unzip the downloaded archive, and place all of its contents into the `MEND` directory.


Note: This is a temporary fix. The acquisition of a permanent link (DOI) for the MEND source code is in progress.
